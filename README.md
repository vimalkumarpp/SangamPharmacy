# SangamPharmacy
This is a Microsoft Azure Web App project that helps the user to know whether their medicines are available in the pharmacy or not.

Problem Statement: In this covid time, the pharmacies are meeting medicine shortage. But the customer doesn't know that their medicines are available in this pharmacy or not. The customers wasting their time in queue to know the medicine availability for buying. So, I created a websiter with azure bot service. This bot helps customers to know the medicine availablity with price in online for a specific pharmacy. Now, the customers can check medicine availability in home with internet connection.

Core Idea: Let the customer know the availability of the medicine in the pharmacy via Azure bot.

How I Done this/Solution : I created Medicine availability bot. It uses Azure web app bot service to check the medicine availabilty. The medicine data are uploaded to bot service using Azure QnaMaker service. This bot is implemented in pharmacy website using Azure web service. Now, the customer can access this platform to know the medicine availability of the pharmacy. I deployed the solution in Azure web app using GitHub actions and the code is written using VS Code.
